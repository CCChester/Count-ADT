# Count-ADT
// a Count is an ADT for storing the count (number of occurrences)
// of an integer within a sequence.

// There is a part A (integers are in the range 1..100)
// and a part B (no restrictions on integers -- any valid C integer)

// for part A, many functions are O(1), but remember that O(100) is O(1)

// for part B, unique integers will be encountered in an order that ensures
// that the resulting BST inserting the integers will be automatically "balanced"
// to guarantee O(log n) behaviour (e.g., for next())
